these graphs are built using the below logic-
1. run all the steps of the iterative prompt, excluding the final XML
2. Removed the logic of including an incomplete Goal Model and asking the LLM to correct it.
3. Added Logic to include 1 textual ideal output.
4. Reordered the IE Links Prompt close to their generation prompt.
5. Run all the criteria on the final XML.
